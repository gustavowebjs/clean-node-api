## Overview

This project adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. ExpressJS serves as the presentation layer, handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Project Structure

The project's architecture is divided into the following main layers:

- **Entities**: Contains the core business rules and business logic.
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulates specific application business rules.
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses. This is where ExpressJS primarily interacts.
- **Presenters**: Format the data to be presented to the users.
- **Repositories**: Handle data access, whether it's from a database, cache, or an external API.

The project uses a directory structure based on these architectural layers, ensuring each component has a designated place and purpose.
